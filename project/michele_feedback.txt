Good job getting a semi-functional app in only the one session you had to work on it. I wanted to see a more complex project because everyone else had 2 other sessions in class to work on it. What I like about your interface is that you can see clearly what format you need me to enter the time in - you tell me “hours” and “minutes.” However, when I actually press “set alarm”, I get an error message “Bad arguments to abs” and this means the alarm clock is not able to be used - I can never set the alarm clock to turn on. I don’t have a screenshot of your design / blocks editors so I can’t tell you where the problem is coming from, but once you fix this problem your app will be more useable. Good job finishing this project.
